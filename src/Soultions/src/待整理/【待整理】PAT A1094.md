# 1094 The Largest Generation (25 åˆ†)

<mark>A family hierarchy is usually presented by a pedigree tree where all the nodes on the same level belong to the same generation. Your task is to find the generation with the largest population.</mark>

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with <mark>two positive integers $N$ ($<100$) which is the total number of family members in the tree (and hence assume that all the members are numbered from 01 to $N$), and $M$ ($<N$) which is the number of family members who have children</mark>. Then $M$ lines follow, each contains the information of a family member in the following format:

    ID K ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K]

where `ID` is a two-digit number representing a family member, `K` (\>0\>0) is the number of his/her children, followed by a sequence of two-digit `ID`'s of his/her children. For the sake of simplicity, let us fix <mark>the root `ID` to be `01`</mark>. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

## Output Specification:

<mark>For each test case, print in one line the largest population number and the level of the corresponding generation. It is assumed that such a generation is unique, and the root level is defined to be 1.</mark>

## Sample Input:

    23 13
    21 1 23
    01 4 03 02 04 05
    03 3 06 07 08
    06 2 12 13
    13 1 21
    08 2 15 16
    02 2 09 10
    11 2 19 20
    17 1 22
    05 1 11
    07 1 14
    09 1 17
    10 1 18

## Sample Output:

    9 4
