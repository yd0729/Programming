# 1050 String Subtraction (20 分)

Given two strings $S_1$ and $S_2$, $S=S_1−S_2$ is defined to be the remaining string after taking all the characters in $S_2$ from $S_1$. <mark>Your task is simply to calculate $S_1−S_2$ for any given strings</mark>. However, it might not be that simple to do it **fast**.

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case consists of two lines which gives $S_1$ and $S_2$, respectively. The string lengths of both strings are no more than $10^4$. It is guaranteed that all the characters are visible ASCII codes and white space, and a new line character signals the end of a string.

## Output Specification:

For each test case, print $S_1−S_2$ in one line.

## Sample Input:

```
They are students.
aeiou
```

## Sample Output:

```
Thy r stdnts.
```

## 题解

读入两个字符串，输出第一个字符串，但是略过在第二个字符串中出现过的字符。
