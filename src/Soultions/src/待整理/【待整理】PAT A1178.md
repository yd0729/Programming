The figure shows the tree view of directories in Windows File Explorer. When a file is selected, there is a file path shown in the above navigation bar. Now given a tree view of directories, your job is to print the file path for any selected file.

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer $N (\le 10^3)$, which is the total number of directories and files. Then $N$ lines follow, each gives the unique 4-digit ID of a file or a directory, starting from the unique root ID `0000`. The format is that the files of depth $d$ will have their IDs indented by $d$ spaces. It is guaranteed that there is no conflict in this tree structure.

Then a positive integer $K (\le 100)$ is given, followed by $K$ queries of IDs.

## Output Specification

For each queried `ID`, print in a line the corresponding path from the root to the file in the format: `0000->ID1->ID2->...->ID`. If the `ID` is not in the tree, print `Error: ID is not found.` instead.

## Sample Input

    0000
     1234
      2234
       3234
        4234
        4235
        2333
       5234
       6234
        7234
         9999
      0001
       8234
     0002
    4 9999 8234 0002 6666

## Sample Output

    0000->1234->2234->6234->7234->9999
    0000->1234->0001->8234
    0000->0002
    Error: 6666 is not found.
