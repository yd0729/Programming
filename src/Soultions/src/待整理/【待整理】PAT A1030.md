# 1030 Travel Plan (30 分)

<mark>A traveler's map gives the distances between cities along the highways, together with the cost of each highway.</mark> Now you are supposed to write a program to help a traveler to decide <mark>the shortest path between his/her starting city and the destination. If such a shortest path is not unique, you are supposed to output the one with the minimum cost, which is guaranteed to be unique.</mark>

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing <mark>4 positive integers $N$, $M$, $S$, and $D$, where $N$ ($\le 500$) is the number of cities (and hence the cities are numbered from 0 to $N−1$); $M$ is the number of highways; $S$ and $D$ are the starting and the destination cities</mark>, respectively. Then $M$ lines follow, each provides the information of a highway, in the format:

    City1 City2 Distance Cost

where the numbers are all integers no more than 500, and are separated by a space.

## Output Specification:

For each test case, <mark>print in one line the cities along the shortest path from the starting point to the destination, followed by the total distance and the total cost of the path.</mark> The numbers must be separated by a space and there must be no extra space at the end of output.

## Sample Input:

    4 5 0 3
    0 1 1 20
    1 3 2 30
    0 3 4 10
    0 2 2 20
    2 3 1 20

## Sample Output:

    0 2 3 3 40

## 题解

求起点到终点的最短路径，要求在路径最短的前提下花费最少。

这种题通用的方法是 dijkstra 求出所有的最短路径，然后通过 dfs 遍历每条最短路径，对每条最短路径计算其在第二标尺下的值。但是本题的花费的计算满足最优子结构，所以可以修改 dijkstra 算法，直接求出满足题意的路径。
