# 1124 Raffle for Weibo Followers (20 分)

John got a full mark on PAT. He was so happy that he decided to hold a raffle（抽奖） for his followers on Weibo -- that is, he would select winners from every N followers who forwarded his post, and give away gifts. Now you are supposed to help him generate the list of winners.

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives three positive integers M ($\le$ 1000), N and S, being the total number of forwards, the skip number of winners, and the index of the first winner (the indices start from 1). Then M lines follow, each gives the nickname (a nonempty string of no more than 20 characters, with no white space or return) of a follower who has forwarded John's post.

Note: it is possible that someone would forward more than once, but no one can win more than once. Hence if the current candidate of a winner has won before, we must skip him/her and consider the next one.

## Output Specification

For each case, print the list of winners in the same order as in the input, each nickname occupies a line. If there is no winner yet, print `Keep going...` instead.

## 题解

### 题意

他将从转发帖子的每个 N 个粉丝中选出获奖者，并赠送礼物。现在你应该帮他生成获胜者名单。

### 输入

每个输入文件包含一个测试用例。对于每个用例，第一行给出了三个正整数 M（≤1000）、N 和 S，即粉丝数、跳过数和第一个获奖者的序号（序号从 1 开始）。然后 M 行，每个行都给出了转发 John 帖子的关注者的昵称（一个不超过 20 个字符的非空字符串，没有空白或返回）。

注意：有人可能会转发不止一次，但没有人可以赢得不止一次。因此，如果获胜者的现任候选人以前获胜过，我们必须跳过他/她，考虑下一个。

### 输出

对于每个案例，按照输入中的相同顺序打印获胜者名单，每个昵称占据一行。如果还没有获奖者，请打印 `Keep going...` ．
