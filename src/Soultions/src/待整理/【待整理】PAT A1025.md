# 1025 PAT Ranking (25 分)

Programming Ability Test (PAT) is organized by the College of Computer Science and Technology of Zhejiang University. Each test is supposed to run simultaneously in several places, and the ranklists will be merged immediately after the test. Now it is your job to write a program to correctly merge all the ranklists and generate the final rank.

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains <mark>a positive number $N$ ($≤100$), the number of test locations.</mark> Then $N$ ranklists follow, each starts with a line containing <mark>a positive integer $K$ ($\le 300$), the number of testees</mark>, and then <mark>$K$ lines containing the registration number (a 13-digit number) and the total score of each testee</mark>. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

## Output Specification:

For each test case, <mark>first print in one line the total number of testees. Then print the final ranklist in the following format:</mark>

    registration_number final_rank location_number local_rank

<mark>The locations are numbered from 1 to $N$</mark>. The output must be sorted in nondecreasing order of the final ranks. <mark>The testees with the same score must have the same rank</mark>, and <mark>the output must be sorted in nondecreasing order of their registration numbers</mark>.

## Sample Input:

    2
    5
    1234567890001 95
    1234567890005 100
    1234567890003 95
    1234567890002 77
    1234567890004 85
    4
    1234567890013 65
    1234567890011 25
    1234567890014 100
    1234567890012 85

## Sample Output:

    9
    1234567890005 1 1 1
    1234567890014 1 2 1
    1234567890001 3 1 2
    1234567890003 3 1 2
    1234567890004 5 1 4
    1234567890012 5 2 2
    1234567890002 7 1 5
    1234567890013 8 2 3
    1234567890011 9 2 4

## 题解

有 N 个考场，给出每个考场中考生的 id 和分数，计算每名学生的总排名和在考场中的排名，并按照中排名输出。

首先给各个考场的考生分别排序，计算出排名，再给所有考生排序，计算出总排名。注意排名和排序结果不一定相同，排名有并列的问题。
