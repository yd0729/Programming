# 1029 Median (25 分)

Given an increasing sequence S of N integers, the median is the number at the middle position. For example, the median of S1 = { 11, 12, 13, 14 } is 12, and the median of S2 = { 9, 10, 15, 16, 17 } is 15. <mark>The median of two sequences is defined to be the median of the nondecreasing sequence which contains all the elements of both sequences.</mark> For example, the median of S1 and S2 is 13.

<mark>Given two increasing sequences of integers, you are asked to find their median.</mark>

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies 2 lines, each gives the information of a sequence. For each sequence, the first positive integer N ($\le 2\times 10^5$) is the size of that sequence. Then N integers follow, separated by a space. It is guaranteed that all the integers are in the range of **long int**.

## Output Specification:

For each test case you should output the median of the two given sequences in a line.

## Sample Input:

    4 11 12 13 14
    5 9 10 15 16 17

## Sample Output:

    13

## 题解

给定两个有序数组，计算二者合并后的中位数。

两个数组都读下来查找会内存超限，需要一边读第二个数组一边找中位数。而且有可能第二个数组已经读完了但是还没有找到中位数的位置。

这道题 408 中也出过，最优算法的时间复杂度为$O(\log_2{n})$，但是在 PAT 考试中没有任何优势，因为把数据读进来已经$O(n)$了，而且还容易写错（毕竟关闭流同步就能水过去）。
