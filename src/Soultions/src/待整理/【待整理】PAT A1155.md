# 1155 Heap Paths (30 分)

In computer science, a **heap** is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: <mark>if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the key of C</mark>. A common implementation of a heap is the binary heap, in which the tree is a complete binary tree. (Quoted from Wikipedia at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap\_(data_structure](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)>))

One thing for sure is that <mark>all the keys along any path from the root to a leaf in a max/min heap must be in non-increasing/non-decreasing order</mark>.

Your job is to check every path in a given complete binary tree, in order to tell if it is a heap or not.

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, <mark>the first line gives a positive integer $N (1<N≤1,000)$, the number of keys in the tree</mark>. Then <mark>the next line contains $N$ distinct integer keys (all in the range of **int**), which gives the level order traversal sequence of a complete binary tree.</mark>

## Output Specification

For each given tree, first print <mark>all the paths from the root to the leaves.</mark> Each path occupies a line, with all the numbers separated by a space, and no extra space at the beginning or the end of the line. <mark>The paths must be printed in the following order: for each node in the tree, all the paths in its right subtree must be printed before those in its left subtree.</mark>

Finally print in a line `Max Heap` if it is a max heap, or `Min Heap` for a min heap, or `Not Heap` if it is not a heap at all.
