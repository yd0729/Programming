# 1028 List Sorting (25 分)

Excel can sort records according to any column. Now you are supposed to imitate this function.

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains <mark>two integers $N$ ($\le 10^5$) and $C$, where $N$ is the number of records and $C$ is the column that you are supposed to sort the records with</mark>. Then $N$ lines follow, each contains a record of a student. A student's record consists of his or her <mark>distinct ID (a 6-digit number)</mark>, <mark>name (a string with no more than 8 characters without space)</mark>, and <mark>grade (an integer between 0 and 100, inclusive)</mark>.

## Output Specification:

For each test case, output the sorting result in $N$ lines. That is, <mark>if $C$ = 1 then the records must be sorted in increasing order according to ID's;</mark> <mark>if $C$ = 2 then the records must be sorted in non-decreasing order according to names;</mark> and <mark>if $C$ = 3 then the records must be sorted in non-decreasing order according to grades</mark>. <mark>If there are several students who have the same name or grade, they must be sorted according to their ID's in increasing order.</mark>

## 题解

给出一些数据，将这些数据按照不同的依据排序后输出。

可以用一个变量来控制比较函数，而比较函数只写一个，这样就避免了需要编写多个比较函数的复杂。
