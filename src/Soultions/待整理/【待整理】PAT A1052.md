# 1052 Linked List Sorting (25 分)

A linked list consists of a series of structures, which are not necessarily adjacent in memory. We assume that each structure contains an integer `key` and a `Next` pointer to the next structure. <mark>Now given a linked list, you are supposed to sort the structures according to their key values in increasing order.</mark>

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains <mark>a positive $N (<10^5)$ and an address of the head node</mark>, where $N$ is the total number of nodes in memory and the address of a node is a 5-digit positive integer. NULL is represented by −1.

Then $N$ lines follow, each describes a node in the format:

```
Address Key Next
```

where `Address` is the address of the node in memory, `Key` is an integer in $[−10^5 ,10^5]$, and `Next` is the address of the next node. It is guaranteed that all the keys are distinct and there is no cycle in the linked list starting from the head node.

## Output Specification:

For each test case, <mark>the output format is the same as that of the input</mark>, where $N$ is the total number of nodes in the list and all the nodes must be sorted order.

## Sample Input:

```
5 00001
11111 100 -1
00001 0 22222
33333 100000 11111
12345 -1 33333
22222 1000 12345
```

## Sample Output:

```
5 12345
12345 -1 00001
00001 0 11111
11111 100 22222
22222 1000 33333
33333 100000 -1
```

## 题解

对链表排序。

输入所有的节点，由于可能存在不在链表上的节点，所以第一步要遍历并标记链表上的节点。然后排序，在排序的时候节点的标记应该是第一标尺。

**注意：**

1. 链表的大小可能为 0
2. 这类题的输出格式
