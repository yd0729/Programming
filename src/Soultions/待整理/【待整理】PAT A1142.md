# 1142 Maximal Clique (25 分)

<mark>A **clique** is a subset of vertices of an undirected graph such that every two distinct vertices in the clique are adjacent. A **maximal clique** is a clique that cannot be extended by including one more adjacent vertex.</mark> (Quoted from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique\_(graph_theory](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_(graph_theory)>))

<mark>Now it is your job to judge if a given subset of vertices can form a maximal clique.</mark>

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives <mark>two positive integers Nv ($\le 200$), the number of vertices in the graph, and Ne, the number of undirected edges.</mark> Then Ne lines follow, each gives a pair of vertices of an edge. The vertices are numbered from <mark>1 to Nv</mark>.

After the graph, there is another positive integer M ($\le 100$). Then M lines of query follow, each first gives a positive number K ($\le$ Nv), then followed by a sequence of K distinct vertices. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

## Output Specification

For each of the M queries, print in a line `Yes` if the given subset of vertices can form a maximal clique; or if it is a clique but not a **maximal clique**, print `Not Maximal`; or if it is not a clique at all, print `Not a Clique`.

## 题解

clique 中所有的点两两之间都有边。先检查这个性质是否满足，如果满足，再检查是否能加入新的点，同时维持这个性质．
