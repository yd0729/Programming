# 1046 Shortest Distance (20 分)

<mark>The task is really simple: given $N$ exits on a highway which forms a simple cycle, you are supposed to tell the shortest distance between any pair of exits.</mark>

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, <mark>the first line contains an integer $N$ (in $[3,10^5]$), followed by $N$ integer distances $D_1 D_2 ⋯ D_N$, where $D_i$ is the distance between the $i$-th and the $(i+1)$-st exits, and $D_N$ is between the $N$-th and the 1st exits</mark>. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space. The second line gives a positive integer $M (≤10^4)$, with $M$ lines follow, each contains a pair of exit numbers, provided that the exits are numbered from 1 to $N$. It is guaranteed that the total round trip distance is no more than $10^7$.

## Output Specification:

For each test case, print your results in $M$ lines, each contains the shortest distance between the corresponding given pair of exits.

## Sample Input:

## 题解

给出一个环，环上有一些点。给出相邻两个点之间的距离。查询任意两点之间的最小距离。

对数据进行预处理，在输入时记录每个点到第 1 个点的距离，由于是一个圆环，所以两点之间只有两条路径，判断一下即可。
