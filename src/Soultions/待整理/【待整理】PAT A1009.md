# 1009 Product of Polynomials (25 分)

This time, you are supposed to find $A\times B$ where $A$ and $B$ are two polynomials.

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies 2 lines, and each line contains the information of a polynomial:

$$K \ N_1 \ a_{N_1} N_2 \ a_{N_2} \ ... \ N_K \ a_{N_K}$$

where <mark>$K$ is the number of nonzero terms in the polynomial</mark>, <mark>$N_i$ and $a_{N_i}$ ($i=1,2, \cdots,K$) are the exponents and coefficients</mark>, respectively. It is given that $1≤K≤10$, $0 \le N_K < \cdots < N_2 < N_1 \le 1000$.

## Output Specification:

For each test case you should output the product of $A$ and $B$ in one line, with the same format as the input. Notice that there must be **NO** extra space at the end of each line. Please be accurate up to 1 decimal place.

## Sample Input:

    2 1 2.4 0 3.2
    2 2 1.5 1 0.5

## Sample Output:

    3 3 3.6 2 6.0 1 1.6

## 题解

先读入第一个多项式，在读入第二个时，计算当前项与第一个多项式的每一项相乘的结果，累加起来就是最后的答案。
