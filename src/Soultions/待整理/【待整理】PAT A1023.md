# 1023 Have Fun with Numbers (20 分)

Notice that the number 123456789 is a 9-digit number consisting exactly the numbers from 1 to 9, with no duplication. Double it we will obtain 246913578, which happens to be another 9-digit number consisting exactly the numbers from 1 to 9, only in a different permutation. Check to see the result if we double it again!

Now you are suppose to check if there are more numbers with this property. That is, double a given number with $k$ digits, you are to tell if the resulting number consists of only a permutation of the digits in the original number.

## Input Specification

Each input contains one test case. Each case contains <mark>one positive integer with no more than 20 digits.</mark>

## Output Specification

For each test case, <mark>first print in a line "Yes" if doubling the input number gives a number that consists of only a permutation of the digits in the original number, or "No" if not.</mark> Then in the next line, print the doubled number.

## Sample Input

    1234567899

## Sample Output

    Yes
    2469135798

## 题解
