# 1146 Topological Order (25 分)

This is a problem given in the Graduate Entrance Exam in 2018: <mark>Which of the following is NOT a topological order obtained from the given directed graph? Now you are supposed to write a program to test each of the options.</mark>

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives <mark>two positive integers $N$ ($\le 1,000$), the number of vertices in the graph, and $M$ ($\le 10,000$), the number of directed edges.</mark> Then $M$ lines follow, each gives the start and the end vertices of an edge. The vertices are numbered from 1 to $N$. After the graph, there is another positive integer $K$ ($\le 100$). Then $K$ lines of query follow, each gives a permutation of all the vertices. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

## Output Specification

<mark>Print in a line all the indices of queries which correspond to "NOT a topological order". The indices start from zero.</mark> All the numbers are separated by a space, and there must no extra space at the beginning or the end of the line. <mark>It is graranteed that there is at least one answer.</mark>

### 思路

拓扑排序的性质是，某个节点的前驱一定在这个节点被访问之前访问。可以通过这条性质来判断是否是拓扑排序．
