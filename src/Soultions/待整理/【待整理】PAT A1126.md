# 1126 Eulerian Path (25 分)

In graph theory, an Eulerian path is a path in a graph which visits every edge exactly once. Similarly, an Eulerian circuit is an Eulerian path which starts and ends on the same vertex. They were first discussed by Leonhard Euler while solving the famous Seven Bridges of Konigsberg problem in 1736. It has been proven that connected graphs with all vertices of even degree have an Eulerian circuit, and such graphs are called **Eulerian**. If there are exactly two vertices of odd degree, all Eulerian paths start at one of them and end at the other. A graph that has an Eulerian path but not an Eulerian circuit is called **semi-Eulerian=**</mark>. (Cited from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path))

Given an undirected graph, you are supposed to tell if it is Eulerian, semi-Eulerian, or non-Eulerian.</mark>

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing 2 numbers N ($\le 500$), and M, which are the total number of vertices, and the number of edges, respectively. Then M lines follow, each describes an edge by giving the two ends of the edge (the vertices are numbered from 1 to N).

## Output Specification

For each test case, <mark>first print in a line the degrees of the vertices in ascending order of their indices</mark>. <mark>Then in the next line print your conclusion about the graph</mark> -- either `Eulerian`, `Semi-Eulerian`, or `Non-Eulerian`. Note that all the numbers in the first line must be separated by exactly 1 space, and there must be no extra space at the beginning or the end of the line.

## 题解

### 题意

在图论中，欧拉路径是所有边都访问一次的路径。欧拉环路是在同一顶点开始和结束的欧拉路径。所有顶点的度都是偶数的连通图都有一个欧拉环路，这些图被称为欧拉图。正好有两个奇数度的顶点的图有欧拉路径但没有欧拉环路，被称为半欧拉图。

给定一个无向图，您应该判断它是欧拉、半欧拉还是非欧拉。

### 输入

每个输入文件包含一个测试用例。每个情况都以包含 2 个数字 N（≤500）和 M 的行开始，这两个数字分别为顶点总数和边数。然后 M 行，每行都通过给出边的两端来描述一条边（顶点从 1 到 N 编号）。

### 输出

对于每个测试用例，首先在一行中打印顶点的度，按序号升序排列。然后在下一行打印您对图的结论——欧拉、半欧拉或非欧拉。请注意，第一行中的所有数字必须用正好 1 个空格分隔，行的开头或结尾不得有额外的空格。

### 思路

用 dfs 判断图是否连通；统计度为奇数的点的个数。
