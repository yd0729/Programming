# 1138 Postorder Traversal (25 分)

Suppose that <mark>all the keys in a binary tree are distinct positive integers</mark>. Given the preorder and inorder traversal sequences, you are supposed to output <mark>the first number of the postorder traversal sequence of the corresponding binary tree</mark>.

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N ($\le$ 50,000), the total number of nodes in the binary tree. The second line gives the preorder sequence and the third line gives the inorder sequence. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

## Output Specification

For each test case, print in one line the first number of the postorder traversal sequence of the corresponding binary tree.

## Sample Input

    7
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    2 3 1 5 4 7 6

## Sample Output

    3
