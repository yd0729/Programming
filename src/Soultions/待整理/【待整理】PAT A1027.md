# 1027 Colors in Mars (20 分)

People in Mars represent the colors in their computers in a similar way as the Earth people. That is, <mark>a color is represented by a 6-digit number, where the first 2 digits are for `Red`, the middle 2 digits for `Green`, and the last 2 digits for `Blue`</mark>. The only difference is that <mark>they use radix 13 (0-9 and A-C) instead of 16</mark>. Now given a color in three decimal numbers (each between 0 and 168), you are supposed to output their Mars RGB values.

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case which occupies a line containing the three decimal color values.

## Output Specification

For each test case you should output the Mars RGB value in the following format: first output `#`, <mark>then followed by a 6-digit number where all the English characters must be upper-cased. If a single color is only 1-digit long, you must print a `0` to its left.</mark>

## Sample Input

    15 43 71

## Sample Output

    #123456

## 题解

把三个在[0, 168]范围内的 10 进制数转换成 13 进制数。由于 10 进制数的范围，转换成的 13 进制数一定最多是两位数，进制转换就变得很容易了。
