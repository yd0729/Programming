# 1183 Recycling of Shared Bicycles (30 分)

There are many spots for parking the shared bicycles in Hangzhou. When some of the bicycles are broken, the management center will receive a message for sending a truck to collect them. Now given the map of city, you are supposed to program the collecting route for the truck. The strategy is a simple greedy method: the truck will always move to the nearest spot to collect the broken bicycles. If there are more than one nearest spot, take the one with the smallest index.

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains two positive integers: NN (≤\\le 200), the number of spots (hence the spots are numbered from 1 to NN, and the management center is always numbered 0), and MM, the number of streets connecting those spots. Then MM lines follow, describing the streets in the format:

    S1 S2 Dist

where `S1` and `S2` are the spots at the two ends of a street, and `Dist` is the distance between them, which is a positive integer no more than 1000. It is guaranteed that each street is given once and `S1` is never the same as `S2`.

## Output Specification

For each case, first print in a line the sequence of spots in the visiting order, starting from 0. If it is impossible to collect all the broken bicycles, output in the second line those spots that cannot be visited, in ascending order of their indices. Or if the job can be done perfectly, print in the second line the total moving distance of the truck.

All the numbers in a line must be separated by 1 space, and there must be no extra space at the beginning or the end of the line.
