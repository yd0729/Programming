# 1184 Arrays and Linked Lists (20 分)

---
Let's design a data structure $A$ that combines arrays and linked lists as the following:

At the very beginning, an integer array $A_0$ of length $L_0$ is initialized for the user. When the user tries to access the iith element $A[i]$, if 0≤i<L00\\le i< L\_0, then A\[i\]A\[i\] is just A0\[i\]A\_0 \[i\]. Now our system is supposed to return h0+i×sizeof(int)h\_0 +i\\times sizeof(int) as the accessed address, where h0h\_0 is the initial address of A0A\_0, and sizeof(int)sizeof(int) is the size of the array element, which is simply **int**, taking 4 bytes.

In case there is an overflow of the user's access (that is, i≥L0i\\ge L\_0), our system will declare another array A1A\_1 of length L1L\_1. Now A\[i\]A\[i\] corresponds to A1\[j\]A\_1 \[j\] (It's your job to figure out the relationship between ii and jj). If 0≤j<L10\\le j< L\_1, then h1+j×sizeof(int)h\_1+j\\times sizeof(int) is returned as the accessed address, where h1h\_1 is the initial address of A1A\_1.

And if there is yet another overflow of the user's access to A1\[j\]A\_1 \[j\], our system will declare another array A2A\_2 of length L2L\_2, and so on so forth.

Your job is to implement this data structure and to return the address of any access.

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives 2 positive integers NN (≤104\\le 10^4) and KK (≤103\\le 10^3) which are the number of arrays that can be used, and the number of user queries, respectively.

Then NN lines follow, each gives 2 positive integers, which are the initial address (≤107\\le 10^7) and the length (≤100\\le 100) of an array, respectively. The numbers are separated by spaces. It is guaranteed that there is no overlap of the spaces occupied by these arrays.

Finally, KK indices of the elements queried by users are given in the last line. Each index is an integer in the range \[0,220\]\[0,2^{20}\].

## Output Specification

For each query, print in a line the accessed address. If the queried index exceeds the range of all the NN arrays, output `Illegal Access` instead, and this query must NOT be processed.

Print in the last line the total number of arrays that have been declared for the whole process.

## Sample Input

    6 7
    2048 5
    128 6
    4016 10
    1024 7
    3072 12
    9332 10
    2 12 25 50 28 8 39

## Sample Output

    2056
    4020
    1040
    Illegal Access
    3072
    140
    3116
    5

## Hint

A\[2\]A\[2\] is just A0\[2\]A\_0\[2\], so the accessed address is 2048+2×4\=20562048+2\\times 4 = 2056.

In order to access A\[12\]A\[12\], declaring A1A\_1 is not enough, we need A2A\_2 with initial address h2\=4016h\_2 = 4016. Since A\[12\]\=A2\[1\]A\[12\] = A\_2\[1\], the accessed address is 4016+1×4\=40204016+1\\times 4 = 4020.

In order to access A\[25\]A\[25\], we need A3A\_3 with initial address h3\=1024h\_3 = 1024. Since A\[25\]\=A3\[4\]A\[25\]=A\_3\[4\], the accessed address is 1024+4×4\=10401024+4\\times 4 = 1040.

The access of A\[50\]A\[50\] exceeds the maximum boundary of all the arrays, and hence an illegal access. There is no extra array declared.

In order to access A\[28\]A\[28\], we need A4A\_4 with initial address h4\=3072h\_4 = 3072. Since A\[28\]\=A4\[0\]A\[28\]=A\_4\[0\], the accessed address is just 30723072.

It is clear to see that A\[8\]\=A1\[3\]A\[8\] = A\_1\[3\] and hence the accessed address is 128+3×4\=140128+3\\times 4 = 140; and A\[39\]\=A4\[11\]A\[39\] = A\_4\[11\] so the accessed address is 3072+11×4\=31163072+11\\times 4 = 3116.

All together there are 5 arrays used for the above queries.
