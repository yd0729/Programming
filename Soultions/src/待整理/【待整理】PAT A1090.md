# 1090 Highest Price in Supply Chain (25 分)

A supply chain is a network of retailers（零售商）, distributors（经销商）, and suppliers（供应商）-- everyone involved in moving a product from supplier to customer.

<mark>Starting from one root supplier, everyone on the chain buys products from one's supplier in a price $P$ and sell or distribute them in a price that is $r$% higher than $P$. It is assumed that each member in the supply chain has exactly one supplier except the root supplier, and there is no supply cycle.</mark>

Now given a supply chain, you are supposed to tell the highest price we can expect from some retailers.

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, The first line contains <mark>three positive numbers: $N$ ($\le 10^5$), the total number of the members in the supply chain (and hence they are numbered from 0 to $N-1$); $P$, the price given by the root supplier; and $r$, the percentage rate of price increment for each distributor or retailer.</mark> Then the next line contains $N$ numbers, each number $S_i$ is the index of the supplier for the $i$-th member. $S_{root}$ for the root supplier is defined to be $-1$. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

## Output Specification:

<mark>For each test case, print in one line the highest price we can expect from some retailers, accurate up to 2 decimal places, and the number of retailers that sell at the highest price</mark>. There must be one space between the two numbers. It is guaranteed that the price will not exceed $10^{10}$.

## Sample Input:

    9 1.80 1.00
    1 5 4 4 -1 4 5 3 6

## Sample Output:

    1.85 2
