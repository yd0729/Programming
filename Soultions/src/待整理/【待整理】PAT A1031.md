# 1031 Hello World for U (20 分)

Given any string of $N$ ($\ge 5$) characters, you are asked to form the characters into the shape of `U`. For example, `helloworld` can be printed as:

    h  d
    e  l
    l  r
    lowo

That is,the characters must be printed in the original order, starting top-down from the left vertical line with $n_1$ characters, then left to right along the bottom line with $n_2$ characters, and finally bottom-up along the vertical line with $n_3$ characters. And more, we would like `U` to be as squared as possible -- that is, it must be satisfied that $n_1 = n_3 = \max \{ k | k \le n_2\ \text{for all}\ 3 \le n_2 \le N \}$ with $n_1 + n_2 + n_3 - 2 = N$.

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains one string with no less than 5 and no more than 80 characters in a line. The string contains no white space.

## Output Specification

For each test case, print the input string in the shape of U as specified in the description.

## Sample Input

    helloworld!

## Sample Output

    h   !
    e   d
    l   l
    lowor

## 题解

### 题意

将给定的字符串按照 U 型输出。这个 U 要尽可能的“圆”，就是竖边要尽可能的长，但是不能超过底边。

### 思路

首先要计算出竖边和横边的长度，设字符串的长度为 len，则竖边$x = (len + 2) / 3$，横边 $y = len + 2 - 2 * x$。然后一行行输出即可。
