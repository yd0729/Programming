# 1016 Phone Bills (25 分)

A long-distance telephone company charges its customers by the following rules:

<mark>Making a long-distance call costs a certain amount per minute, depending on the time of day when the call is made.</mark> When a customer starts connecting a long-distance call, the time will be recorded, and so will be the time when the customer hangs up the phone. <mark>Every calendar month, a bill is sent to the customer for each minute called (at a rate determined by the time of day). Your job is to prepare the bills for each month, given a set of phone call records.</mark>

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. <mark>Each case has two parts: the rate structure, and the phone call records.</mark>

The rate structure consists of <mark>a line with 24 non-negative integers denoting the toll (cents/minute) from 00:00 - 01:00, the toll from 01:00 - 02:00, and so on for each hour in the day.</mark>

The next line contains <mark>a positive number $N$ ($≤1000$), followed by $N$ lines of records.</mark> Each phone call record consists of the name of <mark>the customer (string of up to 20 characters without space), the time and date (`mm:dd:hh:mm`), and the word `on-line` or `off-line`.</mark>

For each test case, <mark>all dates will be within a single month.</mark> <mark>Each `on-line` record is paired with the chronologically next record for the same customer provided it is an `off-line` record.</mark> <mark>Any `on-line` records that are not paired with an `off-line` record are ignored, as are `off-line` records not paired with an `on-line` record.</mark> It is guaranteed that at least one call is well paired in the input. You may assume that <mark>no two records for the same customer have the same time.</mark> Times are recorded using a 24-hour clock.

## Output Specification

For each test case, you must <mark>print a phone bill for each customer.</mark>

<mark>Bills must be printed in alphabetical order of customers' names.</mark> For each customer, <mark>first print in a line the name of the customer and the month of the bill in the format shown by the sample.</mark> <mark>Then for each time period of a call, print in one line the beginning and ending time and date (`dd:hh:mm`), the lasting time (in minute) and the charge of the call.</mark> <mark>The calls must be listed in chronological order.</mark> <mark>Finally, print the total charge for the month in the format shown by the sample.</mark>

## 题解

对于账单的计算可以先统一计算从本月 00:00:00 到时间的费用，挂断时间和挂起时间得到的费用相减就是实际的通话费用，这种方法还可以避免通话跨天时带来的问题。时间在比较时可以统一换算成分钟。
