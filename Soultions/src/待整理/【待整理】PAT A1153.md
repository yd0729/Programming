# 1153 Decode Registration Card of PAT (25 分)

A registration card number of PAT consists of 4 parts:

- the 1st letter represents <mark>the test level</mark>, namely, `T` for the top level, `A` for advance and `B` for basic;
- the 2nd - 4th digits are <mark>the test site number</mark>, ranged from 101 to 999;
- the 5th - 10th digits give the <mark>test date</mark>, in the form of `yymmdd`;
- finally the 11th - 13th digits are <mark>the testee's number</mark>, ranged from 000 to 999.

Now given a set of registration card numbers and the scores of the card owners, you are supposed to <mark>output the various statistics according to the given queries.</mark>

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives <mark>two positive integers $N (≤10^4)$ and $M (≤100)$, the numbers of cards and the queries</mark>, respectively.

<mark>Then $N$ lines follow, each gives a card number and the owner's score (integer in $[0,100]$), separated by a space.</mark>

After the info of testees, there are $M$ lines, each gives a query in the format `Type Term`, where

- `Type` being 1 means to <mark>output all the testees on a given level, in non-increasing order of their scores.</mark> The corresponding `Term` will be the letter which specifies the level;
- `Type` being 2 means to <mark>output the total number of testees together with their total scores in a given site.</mark> The corresponding `Term` will then be the site number;
- `Type` being 3 means to <mark>output the total number of testees of every site for a given test date.</mark> The corresponding `Term` will then be the date, given in the same format as in the registration card.

## Output Specification

For each query, <mark>first print in a line `Case #: input`, where `#` is the index of the query case, starting from 1;</mark> and `input` is a copy of the corresponding input query. Then output as requested:

- for a type 1 query, <mark>the output format is the same as in input</mark>, that is, `CardNumber Score`. If there is a tie of the scores, output in increasing alphabetical order of their card numbers (uniqueness of the card numbers is guaranteed);
- for a type 2 query, <mark>output in the format `Nt Ns` where `Nt` is the total number of testees and `Ns` is their total score;</mark>
- for a type 3 query, <mark>output in the format `Site Nt` where `Site` is the site number and `Nt` is the total number of testees at `Site`.</mark> <mark>The output must be in non-increasing order of `Nt`'s, or in increasing order of site numbers if there is a tie of `Nt`.</mark>

If the result of a query is empty, simply print `NA`.
