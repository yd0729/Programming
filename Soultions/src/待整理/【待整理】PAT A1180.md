# 1180 Arithmetic Progression of Primes (20 分)

In mathematics, an arithmetic progression (AP，等差数列) is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between the consecutive terms is constant. In 2004, Terence Tao (陶哲轩) and Ben Green proved that for any positive nn, there exists at least one arithmetic progression consists of $n$ consecutive prime numbers. For example, { 7，37，67，97，127，157 } is one solution for n\=6n=6. Now it is your job to find a maximum solution for a given nn within a given range.

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case, which gives two positive integers in a line: nn (≤10\\le 10), the number of consecutive prime terms in an arithmetic progression, and MAXPMAXP (2≤MAXP<1052\\le MAXP < 10^5), the upper bound of the largest prime in the solution.

## Output Specification

For each test case, if there exists a solution, print in ascending order the prime numbers in a line. If the solution is not unique, output the one with the maximum common difference. If there is still a tie, print the one with the maximum first number. If there is no solution bounded by MAXPMAXP, output the largest prime in the given range instead.

All the numbers in a line must be separated by a space, and there must be no extra space at the beginning or the end of the line.
