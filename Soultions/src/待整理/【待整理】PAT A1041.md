# 1041 Be Unique (20 分)

Being unique is so important to people on Mars that even their lottery is designed in a unique way. The rule of winning is simple: <mark>one bets on a number chosen from $[1,10^4]$. The first one who bets on a unique number wins</mark>. For example, if there are 7 people betting on { 5 31 5 88 67 88 17 }, then the second one who bets on 31 wins.
