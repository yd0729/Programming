# 1013 Battle Over Cities (25 分)

It is vitally important to have all the cities connected by highways in a war. <mark>If a city is occupied by the enemy, all the highways from/toward that city are closed. We must know immediately if we need to repair any other highways to keep the rest of the cities connected.</mark> <mark>Given the map of cities which have all the remaining highways marked, you are supposed to tell the number of highways need to be repaired</mark>, quickly.

For example, if we have 3 cities and 2 highways connecting $city_1-city_2$ and $city_1-city_3$. Then if $city_1$ is occupied by the enemy, we must have 1 highway repaired, that is the highway $city_2-city_3$.

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing 3 numbers <mark>$N$ ($<1000$), $M$ and $K$, which are the total number of cities, the number of remaining highways, and the number of cities to be checked</mark>, respectively. Then $M$ lines follow, each describes a highway by 2 integers, which are the numbers of the cities the highway connects. The cities are numbered from 1 to $N$. Finally there is a line containing $K$ numbers, which represent the cities we concern.

## Output Specification:

<mark>For each of the $K$ cities, output in a line the number of highways need to be repaired if that city is lost.</mark>

## Sample Input:

    3 2 3
    1 2
    1 3
    1 2 3

## Sample Output:

    1
    0
    0

## 题解

就是如果一个顶点没了，找图中有几个连通分量，需要建路的数量就是连通分量的数量 - 1 。下面记录一种用并查集的方法。

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

#define N 1111

vector<int> graph[N];
int parent[N];
bool visit[N];

int ancestor(int x) {
    int a = x;
    while (a != parent[a]) {
        a = parent[a];
    }
    while (x != parent[x]) {
        int t = x;
        x = parent[x];
        parent[t] = a;
    }
    return x;
}

void combine(int a, int b) {
    int aa = ancestor(a);
    int ab = ancestor(b);
    if (aa != ab) parent[aa] = ab;
}

void init() {
    for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) {
        parent[i] = i;
        visit[i] = false;
    }
}

int main() {
    int n, m, k;
    scanf("%d%d%d", &n, &m, &k);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        int a, b;
        scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
        graph[a].push_back(b);
        graph[b].push_back(a);
    }

    for (int q = 0; q < k; ++q) {
        init();

        int deleted_v;
        scanf("%d", &deleted_v);

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < graph[i].size(); ++j) {
                if (i <mark> deleted_v or graph[i][j] </mark> deleted_v) continue;
                combine(i, graph[i][j]);
            }
        }

        int block = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            if (i == deleted_v) continue;
            int ai = ancestor(i);
            if (not visit[ai]) {
                ++block;
                visit[ai] = true;
            }
        }
        printf("%d\n", block - 1);
    }
}
```
