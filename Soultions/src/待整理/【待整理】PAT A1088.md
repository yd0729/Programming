# 1088 Rational Arithmetic (20 分)

<mark>For two rational numbers, your task is to implement the basic arithmetics, that is, to calculate their sum, difference, product and quotient.</mark>

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case, which gives in one line the two rational numbers in the format `a1/b1 a2/b2`. <mark>The numerators and the denominators are all in the range of long int</mark>. <mark>If there is a negative sign, it must appear only in front of the numerator</mark>. The denominators are guaranteed to be non-zero numbers.

## Output Specification

For each test case, print in <mark>4 lines the sum, difference, product and quotient of the two rational numbers</mark>, respectively. The format of each line is `number1 operator number2 = result`. Notice that <mark>all the rational numbers must be in their simplest form `k a/b`, where `k` is the integer part, and `a/b` is the simplest fraction part</mark>. <mark>If the number is negative, it must be included in a pair of parentheses. If the denominator in the division is zero, output `Inf` as the result. It is guaranteed that all the output integers are in the range of **long int**.</mark>

## Sample Input 1

    2/3 -4/2

## Sample Output 1

    2/3 + (-2) = (-1 1/3)
    2/3 - (-2) = 2 2/3
    2/3 * (-2) = (-1 1/3)
    2/3 / (-2) = (-1/3)

## Sample Input 2

    5/3 0/6

## Sample Output 2

    1 2/3 + 0 = 1 2/3
    1 2/3 - 0 = 1 2/3
    1 2/3 * 0 = 0
    1 2/3 / 0 = Inf

## 题解

实现分数的四则运算。

分数的四则运算很好实现，只要完成假分数的化简即可。
