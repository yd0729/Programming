# 1053 Path of Equal Weight (30 分)

<mark>Given a non-empty tree with root $R$, and with weight $W_i$ assigned to each tree node $T_i$. **The weight of a path from $R$ to $L$** is defined to be the sum of the weights of all the nodes along the path from $R$ to any leaf node $L$.</mark>

<mark>Now given any weighted tree, you are supposed to find all the paths with their weights equal to a given number</mark>. For example, let's consider the tree showed in the following figure: for each node, the upper number is the node ID which is a two-digit number, and the lower number is the weight of that node. Suppose that the given number is 24, then there exists 4 different paths which have the same given weight: {10 5 2 7}, {10 4 10}, {10 3 3 6 2} and {10 3 3 6 2}, which correspond to the red edges in the figure.

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with <mark>a line containing $0<N≤100$, the number of nodes in a tree, $M (<N)$, the number of non-leaf nodes, and $0<S<2^{30}$, the given weight number</mark>. The next line contains $N$ positive numbers where $W_i (<1000)$ corresponds to the tree node $T_i$. Then $M$ lines follow, each in the format:

    ID K ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[K]

where `ID` is a two-digit number representing a given non-leaf node, `K` is the number of its children, followed by a sequence of two-digit `ID`'s of its children. For the sake of simplicity, let us fix the root ID to be `00`.

## Output Specification

For each test case, <mark>print all the paths with weight S in **non-increasing** order.</mark> <mark>Each path occupies a line with printed weights from the root to the leaf in order. All the numbers must be separated by a space with no extra space at the end of the line.</mark>

Note: sequence $\{A_1,A_2,⋯,A_n\}$ is said to be **greater than** sequence $\{B_1,B_2,⋯,B_m\}$ if there exists $1≤k<min\{n,m\}$ such that $A_i=B_i$ for $i=1,⋯,k$, and $A_{k+1}>B_{k+1}$.
