# 1097 Deduplication on a Linked List (25 分)

<mark>Given a singly linked list $L$ with integer keys, you are supposed to remove the nodes with duplicated absolute values of the keys</mark>. That is, <mark>for each value $K$, only the first node of which the value or absolute value of its key equals $K$ will be kept</mark>. At the mean time, all the removed nodes must be kept in a separate list. For example, given $L$ being $21→-15→-15→-7→15$, you must output $21→-15→-7$, and the removed list $-15→15$.

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains <mark>the address of the first node, and a positive $N \ (≤10^5)$ which is the total number of nodes</mark>. The address of a node is a 5-digit nonnegative integer, and NULL is represented by −1.
Then $N$ lines follow, each describes a node in the format:

    Address Key Next

where `Address` is the position of the node, `Key` is an integer of which absolute value is no more than $10^4$, and `Next` is the position of the next node.

## Output Specification

For each case, output the resulting linked list first, then the removed list. Each node occupies a line, and is printed in the same format as in the input.

## Sample Input

    00100 5
    99999 -7 87654
    23854 -15 00000
    87654 15 -1
    00000 -15 99999
    00100 21 23854

## Sample Output

    00100 21 23854
    23854 -15 99999
    99999 -7 -1
    00000 -15 87654
    87654 15 -1

## 题解

### 题意

给出一个链表，删除这个链表中的一些结点，使得每个结点的值的绝对值是唯一的。输出修改后的链表和删除的结点组成的链表。

### 思路

遍历一遍链表，将删除的结点按照顺序放到 `removed`  中，保留的放入 `keep` 中。
