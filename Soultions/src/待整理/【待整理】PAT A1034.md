# 1034 Head of a Gang (30 分)

One way that the police finds the head of a gang is to check people's phone calls. <mark>If there is a phone call between $A$ and $B$, we say that $A$ and $B$ is related</mark>. <mark>The weight of a relation is defined to be the total time length of all the phone calls made between the two persons</mark>. <mark>A "Gang" is a cluster of more than 2 persons who are related to each other with total relation weight being greater than a given threshold $K$</mark>. <mark>In each gang, the one with maximum total weight is the head</mark>. Now given a list of phone calls, you are supposed to find the gangs and the heads.

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains <mark>two positive numbers $N$ and $K$ (both less than or equal to 1000), the number of phone calls and the weight threthold</mark>, respectively. Then $N$ lines follow, each in the following format:

    Name1 Name2 Time

where `Name1` and `Name2` are the names of people at the two ends of the call, and `Time` is the length of the call. A name is a string of three capital letters chosen from `A`\-`Z`. A time length is a positive integer which is no more than 1000 minutes.

## Output Specification:

For each test case, first print in a line the total number of gangs. Then for each gang, print in a line the name of the head and the total number of the members. It is guaranteed that the head is unique for each gang. The output must be sorted according to the alphabetical order of the names of the heads.

## Sample Input 1:

    8 59
    AAA BBB 10
    BBB AAA 20

## 题解

给出一些通话记录，两个人如果有通话，就代表两人之间有关联，权重是两人之间通话的总时长。团伙定义为超过两个人的连通分量，且总通话时长大于 K，团伙的头领定义为团伙中通话时间最长的人。求所有的团伙，输出头领的姓名和人数，按照头领的姓名排序。

1. 给每个名字分配一个 id ，所有通话信息就可以用邻接矩阵表示。
2. 在输入时就可以统计每个人的总通话时间。
3. 用 dfs 统计每个联通分量的总通话时间和人数。vis 数组记录已经访问过的人，为了正确计算联通分量的总权重，在把边累加之后应该清零（注意在累加边权的时候不能使用 vis 来判断）。
4. 用 map 建立头领到人数的映射，map 内部会根据头领排序，可以直接输出。
