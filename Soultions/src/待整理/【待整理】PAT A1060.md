# 1060 Are They Equal (25 分)

<mark>If a machine can save only 3 significant digits, the float numbers 12300 and 12358.9 are considered equal since they are both saved as $0.123×10^5$ with simple chopping</mark>. Now given the number of significant digits on a machine and two float numbers, you are supposed to tell if they are treated equal in that machine.

## Input Specification:

<mark>Each input file contains one test case which gives three numbers $N$, $A$ and $B$, where $N (<100)$ is the number of significant digits, and $A$ and $B$ are the two float numbers to be compared. Each float number is non-negative, no greater than $10^{100}$, and that its total digit number is less than 100.</mark>

## Output Specification:

For each test case, <mark>print in a line `YES` if the two numbers are treated equal, and then the number in the standard form `0.d[1]...d[N]*10^k` (`d[1]`>0 unless the number is 0); or `NO` if they are not treated equal, and then the two numbers in their standard form. All the terms must be separated by a space, with no extra space at the end of a line.</mark>

Note: Simple chopping is assumed without rounding.

## Sample Input 1:

```
3 12300 12358.9
```

## Sample Output 1:

```
YES 0.123*10^5
```

## Sample Input 2:

```
3 120 128
```

## Sample Output 2:

```
NO 0.120*10^3 0.128*10^3
```

## 题解

给出两个数，输出保留 N 位的科学计数法。
注意题中说明保留有效数字是直接截断的（simple chopping），也就是 `ceil` ，不是四舍六入五成双。

题中的标准形式是 `0.d[1]...d[N]*10^k` ，记 s = `d[1]...d[N]` ，那么只需 s 和 k 都相等就可以断定这两个浮点数的标准形式相等。
