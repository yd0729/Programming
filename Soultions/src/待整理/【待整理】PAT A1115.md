# 1115 Counting Nodes in a BST (30 分)

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is recursively defined as a binary tree which has the following properties:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys <mark>less than or equal to</mark> the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

<mark>Insert a sequence of numbers into an initially empty binary search tree. Then you are supposed to count the total number of nodes in the lowest 2 levels of the resulting tree.</mark>

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives <mark>a positive integer $N$ ($\le 1000$) which is the size of the input sequence</mark>. Then given in the next line are the $N$ integers in $[−1000,1000]$ which are supposed to be inserted into an initially empty binary search tree.

## Output Specification

For each case, print in one line the numbers of nodes in the lowest 2 levels of the resulting tree in the format:

    n1 + n2 = n

where `n1` is the number of nodes in the lowest level, `n2` is that of the level above, and `n` is the sum.

## Sample Input

    9
    25 30 42 16 20 20 35 -5 28

## Sample Output

    2 + 4 = 6

## 题解

### 题意

本题的二叉搜索树定义为，节点的左子树中的节点不大于该节点．

在空的二叉搜索树中插入一系列数字。然后，您应该计算生成树最低 2 个级别的节点总数。

### 输入

- `N` ：[1, 1000] 输入序列的长度
- 输入序列： [-1000, 1000]

### 输出

    n1 + n2 = n
