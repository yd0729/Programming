<mark>A **proper vertex coloring** is a labeling of the graph's vertices with colors such that no two vertices sharing the same edge have the same color.</mark> A coloring using at most $k$ colors is called a (proper) $k$**-coloring**.

Now you are supposed to tell if a given coloring is a proper $k$\-coloring.

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, <mark>the first line gives two positive integers $N$ and $M$ (both no more than $10^4$), being the total numbers of vertices and edge</mark>, respectively. <mark>Then $M$ lines follow, each describes an edge by giving the indices (from 0 to $N−1$) of the two ends of the edge</mark>.

After the graph, <mark>a positive integer $K$ ($≤ 100$) is given, which is the number of colorings you are supposed to check.</mark> <mark>Then $K$ lines follow, each contains $N$ colors which are represented by non-negative integers in the range of **int**. The $i$\-th color is the color of the $i$\-th vertex.</mark>

## Output Specification

For each coloring, print in a line `k-coloring` if it is a proper `k`\-coloring for some positive `k`, or `No` if not.

## Sample Input

    10 11
    8 7
    6 8
    4 5
    8 4
    8 1
    1 2
    1 4
    9 8
    9 1
    1 0
    2 4
    4
    0 1 0 1 4 1 0 1 3 0
    0 1 0 1 4 1 0 1 0 0
    8 1 0 1 4 1 0 5 3 0
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 9

## Sample Output

    4-coloring
    No
    6-coloring
    No

## 题解

### 思路

判断一条边的两个点的颜色是否相同，问题的关键在于设计出便于存储边和获得与边相连的点的颜色的数据结构，然后遍历每条边检查即可。
