# 1082 Read Number in Chinese (25 分)

Given an integer with no more than 9 digits, you are supposed to read it in the traditional Chinese way. Output `Fu` first if it is negative. For example, -123456789 is read as `Fu yi Yi er Qian san Bai si Shi wu Wan liu Qian qi Bai ba Shi jiu`. Note: zero (`ling`) must be handled correctly according to the Chinese tradition. For example, 100800 is yi Shi Wan ling ba Bai.

## 题解

用汉语读数。这道题中“10”要读成“Yi Shi”。

汉语读数字是 4 位一个单元，后面再加上“万”，“亿”之类的。可以先按照 4 位进行分组处理。在一组的内部，连续的 0 只读一个。在每组之间，如果某一组的千位为 0，则也要先读一个 0。
