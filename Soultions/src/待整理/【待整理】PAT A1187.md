# 题目详情 - 7-4 Sorted Cartesian Tree (30 分)

A **Sorted Cartesian tree** is a tree of (key, priority) pairs. The tree is heap-ordered according to the priority values, and an inorder traversal gives the keys in sorted order. For example, given the pairs { (55, 8), (58, 15), (62, 3), (73, 4), (85, 1), (88, 5), (90, 12), (95, 10), (96, 18), (98, 6) }, the increasing min-heap Cartesian tree is shown by the figure.

Your job is to do level-order traversals on an increasing min-heap Cartesian tree.

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts from giving a positive integer NN (≤30\\le 30), and then NN lines follow, each gives a pair in the format `key priority`. All the numbers are in the range of **int**.

## Output Specification

For each test case, print in the first line the level-order traversal key sequence and then in the next line the level-order traversal priority sequence of the min-heap Cartesian tree.

All the numbers in a line must be separated by exactly one space, and there must be no extra space at the beginning or the end of the line.

## Sample Input

    10
    88 5
    58 15
    95 10
    62 3
    55 8
    98 6
    85 1
    90 12
    96 18
    73 4

## Sample Output

    85 62 88 55 73 98 58 95 90 96
    1 3 5 8 4 6 15 10 12 18
