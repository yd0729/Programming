# 1152 Google Recruitment (20 分)

In July 2004, Google posted on a giant billboard along Highway 101 in Silicon Valley (shown in the picture below) for recruitment. The content is super-simple, a URL consisting of <mark>the first 10-digit prime found in consecutive digits of the natural constant $e$</mark>. The person who could find this prime number could go to the next step in Google's hiring process by visiting this website.

The natural constant $e$ is a well known transcendental number（超越数）. The first several digits are: $e$ = 2.71828182845904523536028747135266249775724709369995957496696762772407663035354759457138217852516642**7427466391**932003059921... where the 10 digits in bold are the answer to Google's question.

<mark>Now you are asked to solve a more general problem: find the first K-digit prime in consecutive digits of any given L-digit number.</mark>

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. Each case first gives in a line <mark>two positive integers: $L (≤ 1,000)$ and $K (< 10)$, which are the numbers of digits of the given number and the prime to be found</mark>, respectively. <mark>Then the L-digit number N is given in the next line.</mark>

## Output Specification

For each test case, <mark>print in a line the first K-digit prime in consecutive digits of N.</mark> <mark>If such a number does not exist, output `404` instead.</mark> Note: <mark>the leading zeroes must also be counted as part of the K digits.</mark> For example, to find the 4-digit prime in 200236, 0023 is a solution. However the first digit 2 must not be treated as a solution 0002 since the leading zeroes are not in the original number.

## Sample Input 1

### 思路

K<10，所以使用 int 存储就可以。
