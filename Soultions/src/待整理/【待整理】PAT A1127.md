# 1127 ZigZagging on a Tree (30 分)

Suppose that all the keys in a binary tree are distinct positive integers. A unique binary tree can be determined by a given pair of postorder and inorder traversal sequences. And it is a simple standard routine to print the numbers in level-order. However, if you think the problem is too simple, then you are too naive. This time you are supposed to print the numbers in "zigzagging order" -- that is, <mark>starting from the root, print the numbers level-by-level, alternating between left to right and right to left.</mark> For example, for the following tree you must output: 1 11 5 8 17 12 20 15.

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives <mark>a positive integer N ($\le$30), the total number of nodes in the binary tree</mark>. <mark>The second line gives the inorder sequence and the third line gives the postorder sequence</mark>. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

## Output Specification

For each test case, print the zigzagging sequence of the tree in a line. All the numbers in a line must be separated by exactly one space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.

## Sample Input

    8
    12 11 20 17 1 15 8 5
    12 20 17 11 15 8 5 1

## Sample Output

    1 11 5 8 17 12 20 15

## 题解

### 题意

给出后序遍历和中序遍历，输出层序遍历，但本题的层序遍历要求每层翻转一次．

### 思路

通过给出的中序和后序遍历重建这棵树，在重建过程中给每个节点分配一个 index（按照完全二叉树的规则）和 level ，按照 index 和 level 排序后就可以得到层序遍历的结果。
