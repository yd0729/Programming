# 1105 Spiral Matrix (25 åˆ†)

This time your job is to <mark>fill a sequence of $N$ positive integers into a **spiral matrix** in non-increasing order</mark>. <mark>A spiral matrix is filled in from the first element at the upper-left corner, then move in a clockwise spiral.</mark> The matrix has $m$ rows and $n$ columns, where $m$ and $n$ satisfy the following: $m\times n$ must be equal to $N$; $m\ge n$; and $m-n$ is the minimum of all the possible values.

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives <mark>a positive integer $N$</mark>. Then the next line contains $N$ positive integers to be filled into the spiral matrix. All the numbers are no more than $10^4$. The numbers in a line are separated by spaces.

## Output Specification

For each test case, output the resulting matrix in $m$ lines, each contains $n$ numbers. There must be exactly 1 space between two adjacent numbers, and no extra space at the end of each line.

## Sample Input

    12
    37 76 20 98 76 42 53 95 60 81 58 93

## Sample Output

    98 95 93
    42 37 81
    53 20 76
    58 60 76
