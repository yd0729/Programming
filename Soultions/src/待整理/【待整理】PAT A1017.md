# 1017 Queueing at Bank (25 分)

Suppose <mark>a bank has $K$ windows open for service. There is a yellow line in front of the windows which devides the waiting area into two parts.</mark> <mark>All the customers have to wait in line behind the yellow line, until it is his/her turn to be served and there is a window available.</mark> It is assumed that <mark>no window can be occupied by a single customer for more than 1 hour.</mark>

Now given the arriving time $T$ and the processing time $P$ of each customer, you are supposed to tell the average waiting time of all the customers.

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains <mark>2 numbers: $N ($$\le 10^4$) - the total number of customers, and $K$ ($\le 100$) - the number of windows.</mark> Then $N$ lines follow, each contains 2 times: <mark>`HH:MM:SS` - the arriving time, and $P$ - the processing time in minutes of a customer</mark>. Here `HH` is in the range \[00, 23\], `MM` and `SS` are both in \[00, 59\]. It is assumed that <mark>no two customers arrives at the same time</mark>.

Notice that <mark>the bank opens from 08:00 to 17:00</mark>. <mark>Anyone arrives early will have to wait in line till 08:00, and anyone comes too late (at or after 17:00:01) will not be served nor counted into the average.</mark>

## Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the average waiting time of all the customers, in minutes and accurate up to 1 decimal place.

## Sample Input:

    7 3
    07:55:00 16
    17:00:01 2
    07:59:59 15
    08:01:00 60
    08:00:00 30
    08:00:02 2
    08:03:00 10

## Sample Output:

    8.2

## 题解

银行有`k`个窗口，有`n`名用户，给出每名用户的到达时间和服务时间，但是服务时间上限是 1 小时。银行在 8 点开始服务，如果有窗口空闲就会进行服务，如果没有窗口空闲就站在黄线外等待。如果一个用户在 17 点前还没有开始服务，他就不会被服务。计算客户的平均等待时间。

首先按照客户的到达顺序排序。当有客户到达时，选择最先空闲的窗口服务这名客户。如果在客户到达时有多个窗口空闲，选择哪个都可以，这并不影响平均等待时间。
