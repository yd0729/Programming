# 1020 Tree Traversals (25 分)

Suppose that <mark>all the keys in a binary tree are distinct positive integers</mark>. <mark>Given the postorder and inorder traversal sequences, you are supposed to output the level order traversal sequence of the corresponding binary tree.</mark>

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer $N$ ($\le 30$), the total number of nodes in the binary tree. <mark>The second line gives the postorder sequence and the third line gives the inorder sequence.</mark> All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

## Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the level order traversal sequence of the corresponding binary tree. All the numbers in a line must be separated by exactly one space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line.

## Sample Input:

    7
    2 3 1 5 7 6 4
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7

## Sample Output:

    4 1 6 3 5 7 2

## 题解

根据中序遍历和后序遍历计算层序遍历。

根据中序遍历和后序遍历重建这棵树，在这个过程中同时记录节点在层序遍历中的的编号，然后按照这个编号排序就得到了层序遍历的结果。
