# 1026 Table Tennis (30 分)

<mark>A table tennis club has N tables available to the public. The tables are numbered from 1 to N.</mark> <mark>For any pair of players, if there are some tables open when they arrive, they will be assigned to the available table with the smallest number.</mark> <mark>If all the tables are occupied, they will have to wait in a queue.</mark> <mark>It is assumed that every pair of players can play for at most 2 hours.</mark>

<mark>Your job is to count for everyone in queue their waiting time, and for each table the number of players it has served for the day.</mark>

One thing that makes this procedure a bit complicated is that <mark>the club reserves some tables for their VIP members. When a VIP table is open, the first VIP pair in the queue will have the privilege to take it.</mark> However, <mark>if there is no VIP in the queue, the next pair of players can take it.</mark> On the other hand, <mark>if when it is the turn of a VIP pair, yet no VIP table is available, they can be assigned as any ordinary players.</mark>

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains <mark>an integer `N` ($≤$10000) - the total number of pairs of players.</mark> <mark>Then `N` lines follow, each contains 2 times and a VIP tag: `HH:MM:SS` - the arriving time, `P` - the playing time in minutes of a pair of players, and `tag` - which is 1 if they hold a VIP card, or 0 if not.</mark> It is guaranteed that <mark>the arriving time is between 08:00:00 and 21:00:00 while the club is open.</mark> It is assumed that <mark>no two customers arrives at the same time.</mark> Following the players' info, there are <mark>2 positive integers: `K` ($≤$100) - the number of tables, and `M` ($<$ K) - the number of VIP tables.</mark> The last line contains `M` table numbers.

## Output Specification:

For each test case, <mark>first print the arriving time, serving time and the waiting time for each pair of players in the format shown by the sample.</mark> Then <mark>print in a line the number of players served by each table.</mark> Notice that <mark>the output must be listed in chronological order of the serving time.</mark> <mark>The waiting time must be rounded up to an integer minute(s).</mark> <mark>If one cannot get a table before the closing time, their information must NOT be printed.</mark>

## 题解

桌球俱乐部有 K 张球桌，桌子的编号为 1 - K。当一对客户到达时，如果有球桌空闲，就把编号最小的球桌给这对客户使用，否则就必须排队。每对客户最多玩 2 个小时。

有一些球桌是 vip 球桌。当一个 vip 球桌空闲时，队列中的第一对 vip 客户优先使用这个 vip 球桌，如果队列中没有 vip 客户，那么下一对客户可以使用它。当没有 vip 球桌空闲而有一对 vip 客户需要被服务时，可以给他们分配一个普通球桌。

所有的用户都会在 $\[8:00, 21:00\]$ 到达。没有任何用户会在同一时间到达。

按照用户被服务的顺序输出用户的到达时刻、被服务时刻和等待时间。等待时间要被四舍五入到整数。

如果用户不能在关门之前（21:00 之前）获得一张桌子，就不应该输出。
