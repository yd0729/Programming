# 1118 Birds in Forest (25 分)

Some scientists took pictures of thousands of birds in a forest. <mark>Assume that all the birds appear in the same picture belong to the same tree</mark>. You are supposed to help the scientists to <mark>count the maximum number of trees in the forest, and for any pair of birds, tell if they are on the same tree.</mark>

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains <mark>a positive number $N$ ($\le 10^4$) which is the number of pictures</mark>. Then $N$ lines follow, each describes a picture in the format:

$K$ $B_1$ $B_2$ $...$ $B_K$

where <mark>$K$ is the number of birds in this picture, and $B_i$'s are the indices of birds</mark>. It is guaranteed that the birds in all the pictures are numbered continuously from 1 to some number that is no more than $10^4$.

After the pictures there is a positive number $Q$ ($\le 10^4$) which is the number of queries. Then $Q$ lines follow, each contains the indices of two birds.

## Output Specification

For each test case, first output in a line the maximum possible number of trees and the number of birds. Then for each query, print in a line `Yes` if the two birds belong to the same tree, or `No` if not.

## Sample Input

    3 10 1 2
    2 3 4
    4 1 5 7 8
    3 9 6 4

    Yes
    No

## 题解

### 题意

一些科学家在森林里拍摄了数千只鸟类的照片。假设同一张照片中出现的所有鸟类都属于同一棵树。你应该帮助科学家计算森林中树木的最大数量，对于任何一对鸟类，请判断它们是否在同一棵树上。

### 输入

- $N \in [1, 10^4]$ ：照片的数量．
- 接下来 $N$ 行， $K\ B_1\ B_2\ ... \ B_K$ ：照片中鸟的数量和鸟的编号．
- $Q \in [1, 10^4]$ ：查询的数量．
- 接下来每行两只鸟．

### 输出

- 树的最大可能数量和鸟的数量
- `Yes` / `No`
