# 1083 List Grades (25 分)

<mark>Given a list of $N$ student records with name, ID and grade. You are supposed to sort the records with respect to the grade in non-increasing order, and output those student records of which the grades are in a given interval.</mark>

## Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. Each case is given in the following format:

```
N
name[1] ID[1] grade[1]
name[2] ID[2] grade[2]
... ...
name[N] ID[N] grade[N]
grade1 grade2
```

where `name[i]` and `ID[i]` are strings of no more than 10 characters with no space, `grade[i]` is an integer in [0, 100], `grade1` and `grade2` are the boundaries of the grade's interval. It is guaranteed that all the grades are **distinct**.

## Output Specification:

For each test case you should output the student records of which the grades are in the given interval [`grade1`, `grade2`] and are in non-increasing order. Each student record occupies a line with the student's name and ID, separated by one space. If there is no student's grade in that interval, output NONE instead.

## Sample Input 1:

```
4
Tom CS000001 59
Joe Math990112 89
Mike CS991301 100
Mary EE990830 95
60 100
```

## Sample Output 1:

```
Mike CS991301
Mary EE990830
Joe Math990112
```

## Sample Input 2:

```
2
Jean AA980920 60
Ann CS01 80
90 95
```

## Sample Output 2:

```
NONE
```

## 题解

给出一些人的成绩，按照成绩排序并按照给定范围输出，如果没有则输出 NONE。

全部排序，然后遍历，在范围内就输出。
