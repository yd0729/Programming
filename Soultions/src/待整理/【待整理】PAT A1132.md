# 1132 Cut Integer (20 分)

Cutting an integer means to <mark>cut a K digits lone integer Z into two integers of (K/2) digits long integers A and B</mark>. For example, after cutting Z = 167334, we have A = 167 and B = 334. It is interesting to see that <mark>Z can be divided by the product of A and B, as 167334 / (167 $\times$ 334) = 3.</mark> Given an integer Z, you are supposed to test if it is such an integer.

## Input Specification

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives <mark>a positive integer N ($\le$ 20)</mark>. Then N lines follow, each gives an integer Z ($10 \le Z <2^{31}$). It is guaranteed that the number of digits of Z is an even number.

## Output Specification

For each case, print a single line `Yes` if it is such a number, or `No` if not.

## Sample Input

    3
    167334
    2333
    12345678

## Sample Output

    Yes
    No
    No

## 题解

### 题意

把一个数劈成两半，这两半的乘积能够被这个数整除．

### 思路

注意乘积可能是 0。
